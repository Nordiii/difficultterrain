# Difficult Terrain
This module adds the functionality of difficult terrain to any ruler created!
Customizable hotkeys to increase/decrease the multiplier.

This module is somewhat compatible with [Show-Drag-Distance](https://github.com/wsaunders1014/ShowDragDistance) **version 2.1.4**, there are a few bugs, but I am not sure if those are on my end.

Future releases of Show-Drag-Distance may breaks this compatibility, just remove "DragRuler" in this case (difficult terrain module settings).
