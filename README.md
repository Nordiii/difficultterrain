# Difficult Terrain
This module adds the functionality of difficult terrain to any ruler created!
Customizable hotkeys to increase/decrease the multiplier.

## Show Drag Distance
It seems like Difficult Terrain and Show Drag Distance currently **don't work together** (not sure if it's the FoundryVTT or SDD update).
I am thinking about better solutions to integrate modules which extend the ruler class.

This module is somewhat compatible with [Show-Drag-Distance](https://github.com/wsaunders1014/ShowDragDistance) **version 2.1.4**, there are a few bugs, but I am not sure if those are on my end.

Future releases of Show-Drag-Distance may breaks this compatibility, just remove "DragRuler" in this case (difficult terrain module settings). 

## Terrain Layer Support
Basic Terrain Layer support got added with 1.0.4! It is not perfect as you have to set waypoints before entering/exiting different terrain layers, else the first value will be calculated into the whole ruler!

A ruler path segment going over a terrain layer will enforce its multiplier on this segment, other parts can be adjusted with hotkeys

## Known Issues
### Major
(With Terrain Layer compatibility enabled)
* [HexagonalGrid] Ruler sometimes ignores the terrain layer marker
* [SquareGrid] Ruler sometimes ignores the terrain layer marker

Both issues happen because the path does not get calculated the same way how the highlighted ruler path is calculated.
